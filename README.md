## Responsive Webpage Template

The original template of this project page can be seen at [here](https://github.com/richzhang/webpage-template) by [Richard Zhang](https://richzhang.github.io). We have made some beautification and changes. It's very grateful to classmate [Hongzhen Li](https://github.com/chisatooooo) for his contribution.

This project webpage template is mobile responsive! Resizing the webpage will automatically shift elements around to fit the screen. Try a live version [here](https://jasonyzhang.com/webpage-template).

To use this template, clone the repo:
```
git clone --single-branch --branch gh-pages https://github.com/Meaoxixi/FilterPrompt.git
